# SETUP UBUNTU

First make sure you have a partition in your disk that you want ubuntu to take

1. Download Ubuntu ISO [from here](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
- For now use [20.04](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/) LTS as 22.04 has issues

2. Make bootable USB with ISO using Rufus or Startup Disk Creator

3. Boot into USB
 
4. The Ubuntu startup window should appear, and you can proceed to install. If you wish to partition alongisde Windows, make sure to choose that option when prompted

***Note! May need to disable Windows BitLocker (tutorial [here](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-installation-on-computers-running-windows-and-bitlocker-turned-on/15338)) for installation to work***
