# PARTITIONING

Assuming you have a computer with Windows 10/11 as default OS, and want to dual boot with Ubuntu

To partition hard drive use a tutorial [like this](https://itsfoss.com/install-ubuntu-1404-dual-boot-mode-windows-8-81-uefi/#:~:text=In%20the%20Windows%20menu%2C%20search,out%20of%20it%20for%20Linux)

These partition ratios for a 256GB hard drive work well:
- Windows: 150 GB
- Linux 105 GB

Don't worry about these, but EFI takes approximately 300MB and Windows Reserved 1GB
